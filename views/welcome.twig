                        <p>The goal of this project is to bring the <strong>Summers with the Hunts</strong> family reunion cookbook to life in the digital age.
                            The fantastic meals we shared along with a host of others are here online as a living library of Hunt recipes that can grow as our clan grows.
                            You can expand on old recipes, share new ones, and bring your unique tastes and experiences to the table.
                        </p>
                        <p>You don't have to make an account to access the recipes, however, members enjoy additional features like
                            submitting recipes to be added and saving their favorites.</p>
