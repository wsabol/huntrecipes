                    <h2>Hunt Recipes</h2>

                    <p>The Hunt family's love for cooking and gathering around the table began with a special reunion in the
                        summer of 1983, when Dad and Dotty Hunt brought the family together for what would become a cherished
                        tradition. What started as a single summer gathering grew into over 14 years of annual reunions and counting, each one
                        adding new recipes, new family members, and new memories to our collection.</p>

                    <p>In 1997, Joan and Stuart Hunt celebrated these gatherings by creating a family cookbook, preserving
                        the recipes that had become the heart of our reunions. Their dedication captured not just
                        ingredients and instructions, but the spirit of love, laughter, and togetherness that made each dish special.</p>

                    <p>Today, HuntRecipes continues this tradition in digital form. This website serves as our modern family
                        cookbook - a place where Hunt family members can share their favorite recipes, preserve our food
                        traditions, and keep our cooking heritage alive for future generations. From Dad and Dotty's
                        original reunion recipes to new family favorites, each dish here tells a part of our story.</p>

                    <p>Just as our family has grown through the years, so too has our collection of recipes. Whether you're
                        a Hunt by birth, by marriage, or by choice, these recipes are part of your heritage. We invite you
                        to explore, cook, and add your own recipes to our family's culinary legacy.</p>

                    <p>Here's to many more years of cooking, sharing, and creating memories together!</p>
