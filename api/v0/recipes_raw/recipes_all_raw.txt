Fall's gentle shower of leaves may inspire you to make these rich shortbread cookies. Use pear-shaped cookie cutters to
shape the dough or bake traditional Scottish-style shortbread wedges. The buttery flavor makes this cookie melt in your
mouth, so be sure to use the real thing. Start with the plain butter version, then branch out to the ginger or orange-
poppy seed variations. Because these cookies are so rich, you'll want to use regular cookie sheets; insulated cookie
sheets may cause the butter to leak out during baking.

In a medium mixing bowl stir together flour and sugar. Using a pastry blender or fork, cut in butter until the mixture
resembles fine crumbs and starts to cling. From into a ball. Knead in the bowl about 1 minute or until smooth.
On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to 114" thickness. Using desired cutters or a knife, cut into shapes that are 2 to
2-112 inches in diameter, re-rolling and cutting trimmings as necessary. If desired, brush cutouts with milk and
sprinkle with sugar. Arrange on an ungreased cookie sheet.

Bake in a 325 0 oven for 14 to 16 minutes or until bottoms just start to brown. Remove to wire rack to cool.

Makes 12 to 14 cookies

Ginger Shortbread: Prepare cookies as above, except stir 114 cup finely chopped crystallize ginger and 114 tsp. ground
ginger into flour.

Orange-Poppy Seed Shortbread: Prepare as above, except stir 2 tsp. poppy seed and 1 tsp. finely shredded orange peel
into the flour mixture.

2          tart apples, washed, dried,
           cored, pared and sliced
           thinly
2          Tbsp. water
113        cup flour, sifted
113        cup sugar
114        tsp. salt
112        tsp. cinnamon
2-112      Tbsp. butter or margarine



Heat oven to 375°. In a mixing bowl, work together the flour, sugar, salt, ciunamon and butter with pastry blender or
two knives until the mixture is crumbly. Put prepared apples in a greased baking dish and sprinkle with the water,
then put the ciunamon mix over the apples and bake for 30 minutes.




1          lb apples                                  vanilla
4          Tbsp. golden raisins                       drop afmilk
           (optional)
112        tsp. mixed spice or
           cinnamon (optional)
1          cup sugar
2          sticks margarine
4          eggs
1-112      cups self-rising flour, sifted
           pinch of salt


Peel the apples, cut into quarters, core and slice. Cook over low heat with just enough water to cover the bottom of the
pan. The aim is to soften the apples but not fully cook them; otherwise they lose their shape. If you like, this is when
you add the raisins and spice. When cooked, take off heat and place in a greased pan or oven-proof bowl. Set the oven
to 350°.
Cream the sugar and margarine together until smooth. One at a time, fold in the eggs. Sometimes the mixture will
look as if it's curdling. If so, just add a little of the sifted flour and mix thoroughly. After the eggs, fold in the flour.
Add the salt, a few drops of vanilla and a little milk to make the mixture a soft dropping consistency. Spoon the
mixture onto the apples and smooth over. Bake in the center of the oven for 30 to 40 minutes until the top is golden
brown and the topping is cooked through.
The comhination of the apples with the softness and texture of the sponge topping make this a truly mouthwatering
dessert. Depending on your preference, you could add whipped cream or a good vanilla ice cream.
For a diuner partY another option would be to make smaller individual dishes, which would look very impressive on the
table in front of your guests.

vegetables and the chilies. Stir and toss the vegetables until the green onions brighten, about 2 minutes. Stir the wok
sauce, and pour it iuto the wok. Return the chicken to the wok, add the nuts, and stir and toss until all of the
ingredients are glazed with sauce. Taste and adjust the seasoning.

Thaw hens in the refrigerator overnight. Remove gibbets from the cavity; wash hens and pat dry. Truss the hens; or,

Heat oven to 400°. Mix egg, water, oil, salt and pepper and brush over the tops of the hens and over the legs. Grind
the nuts and crumbs together until fairly fine, using the pulse button of a food processor or turning the blender on and
off quickly. Do not over-blend, or the mixture will become pasty.
Pat the crumbs over the hens. Place the hens on a rack in a roasting pan and roast fur about an hour or until done. A
thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh, no touching the bone, should register 180°, and juices should run
clear. Baste occasionally with pan juices or melted butter, using a spoon rather than a brush to keep from brushing the
coating off. Refrigerate. Serve nested on Easter salad.

(Or let sit at room temperature for an hour while your fire burns down.) When coals are medium-hot in the grill, move
them to either side so the drip pan will fit in center. Place lemon shells and rest of rosemary in the pan. Place chicken
skin side up on grill. Sprinkle soaked, drained chips over coals and place cover on grill. Leave vent open so fire doesn't
go out. Cook, without liftiog lid, for one hour, then test chicken with an instant-read meat thermometer. Work qoickly;
you may need to replace the cover and cook some more. If the reading is 170 degrees, remove chicken to a platter, tent
with fuil and let sit fur halfan hour befure carving. (Retained heat will raise the chicken to 180 degrees.)

Place the salmon in a microwave-safe dish. Cover with wax paper and cook on high (100% power) for 2 minutes.
Turn dish and cook for I minute longer on high. Set aside to cool slightly.
In a food processor or blender, process the bread until it forms moist crmnbs. Transfer to a bowl and combine with
green onions, celery, dill, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Mix well. Crumble the sahnon with a fork, discarding any skin
and bones. Add to the crumb mixture and season with mustard. Add the egg whites and stir to moisten. Mixture
should be moist enough to stick together. Form into patties or cakes about 3" in diameter.
Add a small amount of the canola oil to a 12" non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the cakes without crowding
in one or two batches, adding as little oil as possible. Watch carefully to prevent burning. Serve warm or hot with a
dollop of orange tartar sauce.
Makes 4 servings.

Orange Tartar Sauce:
Combine all ingredients and stir well to blend. Sauce can be made up to I day in advance to allow flavors to blend.
Refrigerate until serving.
Test kitchen notes: lithe mixture seems too moist, allow it to rest 15 minutes in the refrigerator beforefonning into patties.
You can substitute regular tartar sauce with orange rindJor the Orange Tartar Sauce recipe to save time.
